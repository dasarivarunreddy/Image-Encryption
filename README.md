# Image-Encryption

Image Encryption
Image encryption is the process of converting an image into a format that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized users. This is achieved through cryptographic techniques that secure the visual data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

# Purpose
The primary goal of image encryption is to protect sensitive visual information from unauthorized access and tampering. This is particularly important for applications in fields such as:

Healthcare: Protecting medical images and patient data.
Finance: Securing images that contain sensitive financial information.
Privacy: Safeguarding personal photos and documents.
How It Works
This project utilizes symmetric encryption algorithms to encrypt and decrypt image files. The key features include:

Symmetric Encryption: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, making it essential to keep the key secure.
Fernet Encryption: This project employs the Fernet symmetric encryption method from the cryptography library, which provides a simple and secure way to encrypt data.

# Benefits of Image Encryption
Confidentiality: Ensures that only authorized users with the correct key can access the original image.
Integrity: Protects against unauthorized modifications, ensuring that the image remains unchanged during storage or transmission.
Compliance: Helps meet regulatory requirements for data protection in various industries.
Supported Formats
The tool currently supports common image formats such as PNG and JPEG. Encrypted images are stored in binary format, preserving the original file structure.

# Usage
To encrypt an image, simply provide the path to the image file, and the tool will generate an encrypted version. The original image can be decrypted using the same key, restoring it to its original form.
